There are three sections in this test. You will hear each section twice.

Now write your Candidate Number in the space provided on page 1 of your Question-Answer Book.

Introduction: Welcome to Science Today. I'm your host Peter Chen. Today we're discussing alternative 
health products and pseudoscience. We have two guests: Dr. Mary Wong, a chemistry professor, and 
Harry Chen, who runs a wellness center.

Peter: Welcome, Mary and Harry. Let's start with detox foot baths. Harry, can you explain how they work?

Harry: Certainly, Peter. The detox foot bath is a revolutionary device. You fill a bowl with warm water, 
add our special solution, then place your feet in. We switch on an electrical current using metal electrodes. 
The toxins in your body are drawn out through your feet, and you can actually see the water turn brown 
as the impurities are released.

Mary: I'm afraid that's misleading, Harry. The brown color comes from the metal electrodes rusting through 
electrolysis, not toxins leaving the body. There's no scientific evidence that toxins can be extracted this way.

Harry: But our customers see results! The water changes color. That's proof it works.

Peter: Mary, what's your take on this?

Mary: The human body has kidneys and a liver that naturally detoxify. These organs are incredibly efficient. 
You can't pull toxins out through your feet. It's physiologically impossible.

Section A: Part 2

Peter: Let's move to another topic. Harry, your center also offers something called Biomagnetic therapy. 
What's that about?

Harry: Biomagnetic therapy uses special magnets placed on different parts of the body to restore balance 
and promote healing. The magnets interact with your body's electromagnetic field.

Mary: Again, there's no credible scientific research supporting this. While the body does produce small 
electrical signals, external magnets don't significantly affect them or promote healing.

Harry: Traditional medicine doesn't have all the answers, Mary.

Mary: You're right that medicine doesn't know everything, but that doesn't mean unproven treatments work. 
We need proper clinical trials and peer-reviewed research.

Section A: Part 3

Peter: Let's discuss vitamin supplements. Are they necessary for most people?

Mary: For the general population eating a balanced diet, vitamin supplements are usually unnecessary. 
However, certain groups—pregnant women, elderly people, or those with specific deficiencies—may benefit.

Harry: I disagree. Modern food is depleted of nutrients due to industrial farming. Everyone needs supplements 
to maintain optimal health.

Mary: That's a common myth. Studies show that most people get adequate nutrition from food. Megadoses 
of vitamins can even be harmful. For example, excessive vitamin A can damage the liver.

Peter: What about vitamin C for preventing colds?

Mary: Large-scale studies show minimal effect. Vitamin C might slightly reduce cold duration in some people, 
but it doesn't prevent colds in the general population.

Section B: Part 1

Announcer: Now look at your question paper. Section B, Part 1. You will hear a discussion about energy drinks 
and their marketing to students. Answer the questions as you listen.

Peter: Today we're examining energy drinks marketed to students. These beverages claim to boost concentration, 
improve athletic performance, and help you study better. Let's look at the ingredients.

Mary: Most energy drinks contain high levels of caffeine—sometimes equivalent to three cups of coffee—plus 
sugar and various additives like taurine and B-vitamins.

Harry: These drinks can be helpful for students burning the midnight oil before exams.

Mary: That's dangerous advice. High caffeine consumption can cause anxiety, sleep disturbances, and heart 
palpitations in young people. The sugar content also leads to energy crashes.

Peter: Are there regulations on marketing these products to minors?

Mary: In some countries, yes, but Hong Kong has limited restrictions. Companies often sponsor school sports 
events and target teenagers with social media campaigns.
