Section A: Part 1

Announcer: HKDSE English Language Paper 3, Listening and Integrated Skills, 2022.

Introduction: Good morning. Welcome to University Life, a radio program for prospective students. 
I'm Sarah Chen, and today we'll discuss campus accommodation options with two current students: 
Tom Williams from the UK and Lisa Zhang from mainland China.

Sarah: Welcome, Tom and Lisa. Let's start with you, Tom. Where do you live?

Tom: I live in a university hall of residence. It's a traditional dormitory building with shared facilities. 
I have a single room, but we share bathrooms and a common kitchen with about twenty other students on our floor.

Sarah: What are the advantages of hall life?

Tom: The main advantage is convenience. I'm right on campus, so I can roll out of bed and be in class within 
ten minutes. It's also great for making friends. There are always people around for meals, study sessions, 
or just hanging out. The hall organizes social events like movie nights and sports competitions.

Lisa: I have a different experience. I rent a flat off-campus with three other students. We each have our 
own bedroom but share a living room, kitchen, and bathroom.

Sarah: Why did you choose to live off-campus?

Lisa: Privacy was important to me. In a shared flat, I have more personal space and quiet time for studying. 
It's also cheaper than university accommodation. My rent is about thirty percent less than hall fees.

Tom: But don't you find it inconvenient being away from campus?

Lisa: Not really. I live about twenty minutes away by bus. The commute gives me time to relax and separate 
university life from home life. I also enjoy having a proper kitchen where I can cook Chinese meals.

Section A: Part 2

Sarah: What about the challenges of your living arrangements?

Tom: Noise can be an issue in halls. Some students party late at night, especially during exam season when 
people cope with stress differently. The shared bathrooms can also get messy, and there are always queues 
in the morning.

Lisa: My main challenge is coordinating with flatmates. We need to agree on cleaning schedules, paying bills, 
and buying groceries. Sometimes people forget their turn to clean, which causes tension.

Sarah: How do you handle conflicts?

Tom: Our hall has a residential tutor who helps mediate disputes. We also have floor meetings where we can 
discuss problems and set ground rules.

Lisa: We try to have regular flat meetings. It helps to address small issues before they become big problems. 
We also have a shared calendar for tracking expenses and responsibilities.

Section B: Part 1

Sarah: Let's discuss budgeting. Tom, what are your main expenses?

Tom: Apart from rent, I spend money on food, transportation, books, and entertainment. The university meal 
plan is convenient but expensive. I've started cooking simple meals to save money.

Lisa: I find cooking at home much cheaper. I spend about half what Tom spends on food. However, I pay for 
bus passes and occasionally eat at restaurants with friends. I also need to budget for furniture and household 
items that university halls provide.

Sarah: Do either of you work part-time?

Tom: Yes, I work ten hours per week at the campus library. It helps cover my living expenses and gives me 
work experience. The library is flexible with my schedule during exams.

Lisa: I do online tutoring for high school students. It's more flexible than a regular job, and I can work 
from home. The pay is decent, and I'm helping students with subjects I'm passionate about.

Sarah: Any advice for new students choosing accommodation?

Tom: Visit the accommodation first if possible. Talk to current students about their experiences. Consider 
your prioritiesâ€”is it location, cost, privacy, or social life?

Lisa: Think about your lifestyle and study habits. If you're sociable and want convenience, halls might suit 
you. If you value independence and cooking, consider off-campus options. Also, read your tenancy agreement 
carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities.
